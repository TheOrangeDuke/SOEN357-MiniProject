      <h1>
        UI/UX case study: a step-by-step guide to the process of designing a
        data marketplace.
      </h1>
      <h3>Statement of the problem</h3>
      <p>
        There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created daily, and this number
        will only grow with the expansion of the internet of things, cloud
        storage and social media. Those bytes of data can come from smart
        devices (speakers, phones, watches, etc.), the internet, social media,
        communication, photos, services, and more. Data is everywhere, and
        companies around the globe pay big bucks to acquire it. They’re willing
        to go far for people’s personal data to be able to target the right
        markets and enhance their revenue, for example by the means of targeted
        ads. Companies that sell people’s personal information can retrieve that
        data by listening to people’s conversations, tracking their search
        histories, retrieving data from forms that they have completed, etc. The
        problem is that the user has consented to their practices when they
        accept their consent form and download or visit their services. The
        reality is nobody reads the totality of the consent form or the terms
        and conditions that determine what companies can do with their data. The
        result of this is that users discard their data privacy. We believe that
        everyone should have a say on how their personal data is used, and who
        can benefit from it. The goal of DataPiggy is to create a personal data
        marketplace where users can freely sell their data to whoever they want
        to, for whatever purpose they feel comfortable with, and profit from it.
      </p>
      <h3>Research Methods</h3>
      <p>
        Eight questionnaires and 25 forms were completed by potential users to
        help us better understand what people would want from a data
        marketplace.
      </p>
      <h4>Online forms</h4>
      <p>
        The key points retrieved from the online forms were that users generate
        a lot of data on social media, and are generally concerned about their
        data privacy. They are most willing to sell social media information and
        likes, and almost never wanted to sell personal conversations and
        emails. It was no surprise to find out that they wanted to choose the
        data they could sell and set a price for it. Some comments received on
        the form included
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>Updates on how my data is used. In which domain my data is used.</q>
        We addressed this by showing a history of past transactions, along with
        who they sold their data to and for what. We made sure to incorporate
        those needed features in our design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>Cost per data depending on type</q> We addressed this by showing how
        much the data they selected usually sells for. They are still allowed to
        set any price they want though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>Possibility to opt-out of any data selling</q> In our app, users will
        accept offers manually. To avoid selling any data, one must simply not
        accept any offers - but they are still shown which companies want to buy
        their data, which is still interesting.

      <h4>Interviews</h4>
      <p>
        We also conducted interviews to get a better feeling of our users’
        needs. The conclusion we got from the interviews resembled the one from
        the forms. However, after speaking with our users, it was revealed that
        there were concerns about security and transparency. Recent fraud events
        across Quebec have left the people wary, and it’s essential that our
        users know our platform is secure. The users also wanted information
        about who was buying their data, and it was important to them that they
        could set the price themselves.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h4>Personas</h4>
      <p>
        Results from interacting with our users suggested that there could be
        different types of users that could use DataPiggy. Creating personas
        helped us better understand our users’ needs, experiences, goals, and
        behaviors. The three personas are two extreme views (sell everything and
        sell nothing) and one moderate view (sell some data selectively).

      <h4>Example of marketplace</h4>
      <p>
        Before jumping into designing and creating charts, it was important to
        see examples of current marketplaces to have a better understanding of
        what users are used to. Popular marketplace includes but isn’t limited
        to Facebook, Kijiji, Letgo. From a seller perspective, these popular
        websites have some points in common, the UI/UX is very simple, and
        minimalist. When selling an item, you can choose a category and attached
        to it a price. It’s key to keep the same approach to create a sentiment
        of familiarity.

      <h4>User journey</h4>
      <p>
        In this user journey, the persona of Emma Bison is going to set up an
        account for DataPiggy. She is apprehensive at first, and her emotional
        state is low. As the journey progresses, she becomes more comfortable
        with the idea of selling her data. Included in this user journey are her
        thoughts, actions, emotional state, and finally the things to keep in
        mind for the designers based on all these.

      <h4>Storyboard</h4>
      <p>
        This storyboard explains the thoughts and feelings of Sandy. She feels
        watched by her devices and the softwares she uses, represented by the
        red eyes watching her. She knows “They” are watching her and collecting
        her data, but she doesn’t know who “They” are, and what they are doing
        with it. When she discovers DataPiggy, she feels in control, and
        informed about what is happening with her data. She even gets paid! In
        the end, the eyes are still watching, but they are less threatening to
        her now.

      <h3>Visual Research</h3>
      <h4>Iterations</h4>
      <p>
        The name DataPiggy came from merging the familiarity of a simple piggy
        bank and the main theme of data. The team wanted a simple logo that
        could fit with our style guides. After multiple iterations, a monochrome
        colour was chosen.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
        <img class="img-section" src="./images/logos/logo_iteration.png" />
      </div>
      <h4>Style guides</h4>
      <p>
        For our style guide, the burgundy, sunglow, and my sin colours were
        chosen. The burgundy colour symbolizes ambition, wealth, and power,
        which mix perfectly with the empowerment that we want to give our user
        with their data. Sunglow, and my sin mix perfectly with the burgundy
        colour, which create an efficient palette. For the typography, the team
        decided to go with Montserrat. Montserrat is a popular and neat font
        from adobe. We wanted a simple font to go well with DataPiggy. For the
        icons, FontAwesome icons were chosen by the team. They are free, and
        offers multiple icons on data, banking, technologies, etc., which made
        the choice simple.

      <h4>Animations</h4>
      <p>
        In today's world, animations are key to an application. Users are used
        to interactive websites, and it adds a lot of fun and life to the
        websites. DataPiggy will have a custom splash screen while the user
        information is being fetched.
