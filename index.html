      <h1>
        UI/UX case study: a step-by-step guide to the process of designing a
        data marketplace.
      </h1>
      <h3>Statement of the problem</h3>
      <p>
        There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created daily, and this number
        will only grow with the expansion of the internet of things, cloud
        storage and social media. Those bytes of data can come from smart
        devices (speakers, phones, watches, etc.), the internet, social media,
        communication, photos, services, and more. Data is everywhere, and
        companies around the globe pay big bucks to acquire it. They’re willing
        to go far for people’s personal data to be able to target the right
        markets and enhance their revenue, for example by the means of targeted
        ads. Companies that sell people’s personal information can retrieve that
        data by listening to people’s conversations, tracking their search
        histories, retrieving data from forms that they have completed, etc. The
        problem is that the user has consented to their practices when they
        accept their consent form and download or visit their services. The
        reality is nobody reads the totality of the consent form or the terms
        and conditions that determine what companies can do with their data. The
        result of this is that users discard their data privacy. We believe that
        everyone should have a say on how their personal data is used, and who
        can benefit from it. The goal of DataPiggy is to create a personal data
        marketplace where users can freely sell their data to whoever they want
        to, for whatever purpose they feel comfortable with, and profit from it.
      </p>
      <h3>Research Methods</h3>
      <p>
        Eight questionnaires and 25 forms were completed by potential users to
        help us better understand what people would want from a data
        marketplace.
      </p>
      <h4>Online forms</h4>
      <p>
        The key points retrieved from the online forms were that users generate
        a lot of data on social media, and are generally concerned about their
        data privacy. They are most willing to sell social media information and
        likes, and almost never wanted to sell personal conversations and
        emails. It was no surprise to find out that they wanted to choose the
        data they could sell and set a price for it. Some comments received on
        the form included:
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>Updates on how my data is used. In which domain my data is used.</q>
        We addressed this by showing a history of past transactions, along with
        who they sold their data to and for what. We made sure to incorporate
        those needed features in our design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>Cost per data depending on type.</q> We addressed this by showing how
        much the data they selected usually sells for. They are still allowed to
        set any price they want though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <q>Possibility to opt-out of any data selling.</q> In our app, users
        will accept offers manually. To avoid selling any data, one must simply
        not accept any offers - but they are still shown which companies want to
        buy their data, which is still interesting.

        />
      </div>
      <h4>Interviews</h4>
      <p>
        We also conducted interviews to get a better feeling of our users’
        needs. The conclusion we got from the interviews resembled the one from
        the forms. However, after speaking with our users, it was revealed that
        there were concerns about security and transparency. Recent fraud events
        across Quebec have left the people wary, and it’s essential that our
        users know our platform is secure. The users also wanted information
        about who was buying their data, and it was important to them that they
        could set the price themselves.

        <a href="https://bit.ly/3bzTcmI">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Personas</h4>
      <p>
        Results from interacting with our users suggested that there could be
        different types of users that could use DataPiggy. Creating personas
        helped us better understand our users’ needs, experiences, goals, and
        behaviors. The three personas are two extreme views (sell everything and
        sell nothing) and one moderate view (sell some data selectively).
      </p>

          class="img-section"
          src="./images/personas/george_marcus_persona.png"
        />
      </div>
      <h4>Example of marketplace</h4>
      <p>
        Before jumping into designing and creating charts, it was important to
        see examples of current marketplaces to have a better understanding of
        what users are used to. Popular marketplace includes, but aren’t limited
        to, Facebook, Kijiji, Letgo. From a seller perspective, these popular
        websites have some points in common. The UI/UX is very simple and
        minimalist. When selling an item, you can choose a category and attached
        to it a price. It’s key to keep the same approach to create a sentiment
        of familiarity.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the examples that were examined, we were able to determine the
        basic pages needed in a marketplace, such as a page for indicating what
        to sell, a page where users can see the history of their transactions,
        etc.
      </p>
      <h4>User journey</h4>
      <p>
        In this user journey, the persona of Emma Bison is going to set up an
        account for DataPiggy. She is apprehensive at first, and her emotional
        state is low. As the journey progresses, she becomes more comfortable
        with the idea of selling her data. Included in this user journey are her
        thoughts, actions, emotional state, and finally the things to keep in
        mind for the designers based on all these.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
        <img class="img-section" src="./images/user_journey.jpg" />
      </div>
      <h4>User flowchart</h4>
      <p>
        Mapping the basic flow of the app ensured that the team understood every
        step that the users will take. It helped clarify how the user would do
        basic functions, and discover ways to make the process smooth and
        simple. It helped define the customer experience and the user needs.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
        <img class="img-section" src="./images/user_flow.jpg" />
      </div>
      <h4>Sketches</h4>
      <p>
        The initial set of sketches was created in order to gain the ability to
        see what page controls the user would need. It was initially seeded in
        our user flow - helping us guarantee that every action that a user would
        need to take had a corresponding control on our page. In addition, the
        sketches helped us think further of the usability of the application
        itself - what notifications would be needed, what data should be
        displayed. The main advantage of a lo-fi sketch is that it is the most
        cost-efficient (at least in terms of time) way to express a set of ideas
        and a flow.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
        <img class="img-section" src="./images/miniproject_sketch.png" />
      </div>
      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>
        The wireframes originated from the sketches but also from our research
        about the different marketplaces. We tried to imitate the known format
        of existing marketplaces in order to make the user more at ease with our
        It is at this point that we came up with the idea of incorporating
        explanatory boxes as a first-class citizen of our UI in order to help
        two criteria that we had identified: people don’t like reading “terms
        and conditions” and when they do, they rarely understand what is implied
        or they forget. As a result, we put explanatory boxes next to every
        important control on the application, and we started working on the
        language used in these boxes - making the controls clear without using
        intimidating legalese (legal terms). Also at this point in time, we
        decided that some of our sketches’ drawings were better served as modal
        dialogs in order to contextualize them better. We also came up with the
        concept of “recurring transactions” which would give more insight to the
        user as to who is buying their data.

      <h4>Mockups</h4>
      <p>
        Once we de-risked and iterated over most of the controls, and the logo
        and style guide was ready, we started our work on the mock-ups.
        Last-minute additions were created in order to enhance the ease-of-use
        of the application. The first one was revisiting the texts in our user
        interface in order to make them shorter and clearer. Secondly, we added
        a hover-over symbol on our dashboard for our Instant Offers, which
        enable the more experienced users to do a single-click accept.

      <h4>Storyboard</h4>
      <p>
        This storyboard explains the thoughts and feelings of Sandy. She feels
        watched by her devices and the software she uses, represented by the red
        eyes watching her. She knows “They” are watching her and collecting her
        data, but she doesn’t know who “They” are, and what they are doing with
        it. When she discovers DataPiggy, she feels in control, and informed
        about what is happening with her data. She even gets paid! In the end,
        the eyes are still watching, but they are less threatening to her now.

      <h3>Visual Research</h3>
      <h4>Iterations</h4>
      <p>
        The name DataPiggy came from merging the familiarity of a simple piggy
        bank and the main theme of data. The team wanted a simple logo that
        could fit with our style guides. After multiple iterations, a monochrome
        color was chosen.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
        <img class="img-section" src="./images/logos/logo_iteration.png" />
      </div>
      <h4>Style guides</h4>
      <p>
        For our style guide, the burgundy, sunglow, and my sin colors were
        chosen. The burgundy color symbolizes ambition, wealth, and power, which
        mix perfectly with the empowerment that we want to give our users with
        their data. Sunglow and my sin mix perfectly with the burgundy colour,
        which creates an efficient palette. For the typography, the team decided
        to go with Montserrat. Montserrat is a popular and neat font from adobe.
        We wanted a simple font to go well with DataPiggy. For the icons,
        FontAwesome icons were chosen by the team. They are free and offer
        multiple icons on data, banking, technologies, etc., which made the
        choice simple.
      </p>
      <div class="img">
        <img class="img-section" src="./images/style_guide.png" />
      </div>
      <h4>Animations</h4>
      <p>
        In today's world, animations are key to an application. Users are used
        to interactive websites, and it adds a lot of fun and life to the
        websites. DataPiggy will have a custom splash screen while the user
        information is being fetched.

      </div>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the problem that exists today is that users feel that
        companies are taking their data without them knowing, and without them
        knowing why and for what purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through online forms and interviews, we discovered what users want and
        don’t want. Users are mostly willing to sell at least parts of their
        data. They want to feel in control over what is sold and for how much.
      </p>
      <p>
        From these questionnaires and interviews, we were able to come up with
        three personas: the George Markus, who firmly believes that companies
        will get his data anyways and is willing to sell almost anything. The
        Earl Kosovich, who is incredibly wary of any companies having his data,
        and the Emma Bison, who is selective about what she wants to sell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examining other marketplaces helped us determine what pages we needed -
        for example, a screen where users set what they want to sell and a
        screen to see a history of what they sold.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a user journey, we were able to visualize the emotional state of
        the user at every step, and with the user flowchart, we were able to map
        the user’s path. Finally, a storyboard gave us direction and purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these user research tools helped us determine what the sketches,
        wireframes, and mockups would look like. For DataPiggy, we wanted to
        keep everything as clear as possible and inform the user of how it works
        and make them feel in control. We kept the language easy to understand
        so the user felt safe. The color scheme and logo evolved throughout the
        project, and finally, an animation splash screen was created to add fun
        and please the user.
